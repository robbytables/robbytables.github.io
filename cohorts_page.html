                    <p class="testimonial-text">Robby's coaching has helped me enter interviews with more confidence and a new perspective. Before every interview, I review our notes, and it helps me get my mind right for the tasks ahead. I absolutely would recommend Robby as a coach if you get the chance!</p>

                    <p class="testimonial-text">Robby brings a wealth of experience in interview prep, particularly in systems design, along with a genuine commitment to supporting underrepresented groups in tech. Working with Robby, I was able to better recognize and leverage my strengths and while gaining clarity on areas to focus on to improve my interviews. Together, we strengthened my application materials, which made a significant difference in standing out to employers.</p>

                <div class="testimonial-bubble fade-in">
                    <p class="testimonial-text">Robby's coaching has been the game-changer I needed to elevate my career. From the very first session, I felt the immediate impact of his expertise. His guidance has been instrumental in boosting my confidence, helping me understand my worth, and shaping a career path tailored to my goals. His personable and thoughtful approach makes every session a great experience and I highly recommend him to anyone looking to take their career to the next level.</p>

                    <p class="testimonial-text">Robby helped me to be more confident in interviews and made the interview process way more enjoyable. Robby also helped me to know what to talk about and how to present myself to interviews even if I was nervous and got flustered. I highly recommend working with Robby especially if you feel like you're really close to getting the role and keep getting passed up.</p>
                    <div class="testimonial-author">-- Jade T, Fullstack Software Engineer</div>
                </div>
                <div class="testimonial-bubble testimonial-full-width fade-in">
                    <p class="testimonial-text">I had such a great experience working with Robby that I recommended her to several others who were in search of coaching. In fact just recently, one of them messaged me to say (and I quote) 'THANK YOU!'. I think that speaks for itself, but in case it doesn't...Robby was instrumental in helping me to review my resume, get clear and specific on my goals, coming up with a plan of action to attack them, and in general helping me to build my confidence in myself in this grueling market. I felt heard and understood as a female POC in the tech world, and Robby was sensitive to both that and my ADHD, but never shied away from telling me what I needed to hear to make the right changes. Robby is also a master of system design and just watching her coach others in that area left me with so many key insights that I truly believe helped me land a job. If you've made it this far and haven't booked that session yet...what are you waiting for?</p>

                    <div class="faq-question">Do I have to pay up-front?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">I ask for 25% to hold your place in the cohort. The remainder is due by the end of Week 1 of the cohort.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item fade-in">
                    <div class="faq-question">How do you decide to admit someone to the cohort?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">The cohort will heavily be based on my coaching style, which is fairly accesible to engineers of all backgrounds. The intro call will be important to make sure that the group setting and my style will work for you- my goal is to set you and the cohort up for success.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item fade-in">
                    <div class="faq-question">How much time commitment is required each week?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">You will be required to participate in 2 hour of group sessions per week, and at least 1 hour of 1:1 time with Robby. Expect there to be homework, but the amount is on a per-case basis. Remember that this is a part of your winning strategy- the rest will be on you, but the more you bring to the cohort the more you will get out of it!</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">What if I can't attend a session?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Life happens, so if there is an emergency or an illness and you cannot make it, that's ok. Group sessions cannot be made up- though you may have access to summaries and/or recordings. Up to 1 hour of 1:1 coaching may be "rolled over" to the next week with Robby- but this should only be on an emergent basis.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">What happens if I don't find a job during the program?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">It's not guaranteed that you will find a job during this program. Over 50% of my coaching clients find employment during the first 30 days of us working together, but everyone's journey is unique. I can guarantee that you will gain indispensible skills and insights that will bootstrap your job search and be indispensible in all stages of your career. Cohort members will receive first dibs on joining further cohorts, and may be eligible for a discount as well.</div>

                    <div class="faq-answer">I work with software engineers of all level, as long as they have some form of industry experience. Whether you hold a 4 year CS degree, bootcamp education, or are self taught, all are welcome. SWEs of all backgrounds, industries, and technical stacks will find value in this program.</div>
